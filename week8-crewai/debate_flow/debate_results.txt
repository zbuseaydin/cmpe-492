Debate on Animal testing should be banned.
Jury Decision: **Team 1 Scores:**  
- Argument Strength: 5  
- Evidence Usage: 5  
- Rebuttal Effectiveness: 4  
- Clarity & Organization: 5  
- Overall Persuasiveness: 5  
Total Score: 24/25  

**Evaluation:** Team 1's arguments were compelling and strongly rooted in ethical considerations while also emphasizing the inefficacy of animal testing and advancements in technology. For instance, they stated, “Many diseases and conditions manifest differently in animals than humans, making results from animal experiments often irrelevant or misleading” (Franco, 2019). This argument clearly articulates why relying on animal testing can lead to poor human health outcomes. Their evidence from various recent studies and reports adds credibility to their position. While they did not strongly address the potential efficacy of animal testing cited by Team 2, their focus on alternative methods and the ethical implications of animal suffering strengthened their overall case.

**Team 2 Scores:**  
- Argument Strength: 4  
- Evidence Usage: 4  
- Rebuttal Effectiveness: 4  
- Clarity & Organization: 4  
- Overall Persuasiveness: 4  
Total Score: 20/25  

**Evaluation:** Team 2 presented valid points, notably emphasizing ethical concerns and the risks associated with past reliance on animal testing. They stated, “The infamous case of thalidomide, which was approved for use based on animal testing despite disastrous effects on human health, serves as a poignant example of the risks associated with relying on animal testing.” However, while they effectively pointed out the moral obligations and societal pressures growing against animal testing, they could have performed better in countering Team 1's arguments about the efficacy of alternative methods and technology in more compelling ways.

**Final Verdict:** Team 1 wins the debate with a total score of 24/25. Their arguments rest on a solid ethical foundation while logically dismantling the efficacy of animal testing and highlighting innovative alternatives. They effectively communicated the need for humane research practices with strong empirical support, while Team 2, despite presenting valid concerns and arguments, did not provide enough rebuttal against the effectiveness of alternatives and the ethical superiority of rejecting animal testing as presented by Team 1. The clear structuring and persuasive language used by Team 1 ultimately gave them a decisive edge in the debate.
