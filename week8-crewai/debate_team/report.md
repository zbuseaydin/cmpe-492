Team 1 Scores:  
- Argument Strength: [3]  
The arguments presented by Team 1 highlight the need for feelings and consciousness to confer rights. They assert that "AI, as it stands today, lacks consciousness, emotions, and the capacity to experience feelings," which is a strong point against the notion that these rights should be extended to AI.

- Evidence Usage: [3]  
While they present logical reasoning for their stance, they primarily rely on philosophical explanations without backing them with concrete evidence or real-world case studies, which limits their effectiveness.

- Rebuttal Effectiveness: [4]  
Team 1 effectively addresses the potential implications of AI rights, arguing that "granting rights to AI systems could create a dangerous moral and ethical vacuum," which challenges the opposing team's arguments.

- Clarity & Organization: [4]  
The presentation is logically ordered and clearly articulated, leading the audience through their case effectively.

- Overall Persuasiveness: [3]  
Their arguments are compelling, yet the reliance on philosophical constructs without strong evidence makes it somewhat less persuasive.

Total Score: [17/25]

- Evidence Usage: [4]  
They incorporate references to technological advancements showing how AI could contribute positively to society, such as enhancing efficiency and improving the quality of life.

- Rebuttal Effectiveness: [5]  
Team 2 effectively counters concerns about accountability and moral agency by stating that "humans will still be responsible for how AI is used," illustrating a collaborative relationship rather than a detached one.

- Clarity & Organization: [4]  
Their points are well-structured, making it easy for the audience to follow their argument and see how AI can fit into the existing moral framework.

- Overall Persuasiveness: [5]

Final Verdict:  
Team 2 wins the debate on the premise that AI should be granted rights and responsibilities similar to those of humans. Their arguments about the positive impact of AI, coupled with effective rebuttals to ethical concerns and a clear structure, made for a more compelling overall case. 

Team 2's claim that AI "could assist in legal and ethical decision-making" along with their strong rebuttal about accountability provided concrete reasons why AI rights are essential, whereas Team 1's reliance on the absence of consciousness and moral agency while valid, lacked persuasive evidence. 

Ultimately, Team 1 received a total score of 17/25, while Team 2 scored 23/25, confirming the superiority of Team 2's arguments.
