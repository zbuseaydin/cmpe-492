Final Verdict: Team 2 is the clear winner of this debate. 

The arguments put forth by Team 2 were robust and logically sound throughout their presentation. They articulated that "AI lacks the ability to experience consciousness, awareness, or genuine thought," which directly addresses the core premise of the affirmative team. By emphasizing the absence of consciousness, they effectively argued that rights are predicated on a being's capacity for moral understanding.

Furthermore, Team 2 robustly refuted the notion of moral agency typically associated with AI, stating, "the idea that AI systems can bear moral weight is simply illogical, as they lack the essential attributes that constitute true moral agency." This strong rebuttal highlighted the fundamental differences between humans and AI, setting a clear boundary for why AI should not share similar rights.

The negative team also demonstrated an excellent understanding of the implications surrounding accountability and liability when they said, "If an AI system malfunctions or inflicts harm, the responsibility automatically reverts back to human developers and users." Their comprehensive grasp of the legal and ethical landscapes surrounding AI further strengthened their argument.

In terms of clarity and organization, Team 2 presented a well-structured case, delving comprehensively into several dimensions including economic ramifications, privacy issues, and the lack of global consensus on AI rights. They concluded with a morally compelling reminder that "responsibility, empathy, and moral understanding remain uniquely human domains."

Overall, Team 2's performance was exceptionally persuasive, clearly articulating and defending their position against the affirmative's arguments while providing a rich foundation of evidence and reasoning. Thus, Team 2 exemplified superior argumentation and secured a decisive win in this debate.
