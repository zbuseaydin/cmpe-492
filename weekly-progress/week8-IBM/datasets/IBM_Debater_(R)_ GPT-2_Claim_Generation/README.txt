NAME: IBM Debater(R) - Claim Generation Dataset

VERSION: v1

RELEASE DATE: 16.11.2020

DATASET OVERVIEW 

1. File generated_texts_plausibility_stance.csv: 2,739 texts generated by various GPT-2 fine-tuned models, on 131 topics from the dev and test sets, labeled for plausibility and stance.  
2. File generated_texts_factual_opinion.csv: 400 generated texts from the test set labeled for whether they are factual or opinion.
3. File generated_texts_covid_19.csv: 100 generated texts on 5 topics related to the covid-19 pandemic.

CONTENT

The CSV file generated_texts_plausibility_stance.csv contains the following information:

1. prefix - the prefix used to generated the text (either the topic, or the first Wikipedia sentence of the relevant Wikipedia title followed by the topic)
2. topic - the topic
3. text - the generated text
4. set - whether the topic belongs to the dev or test set
5. model - the fine-tuned model used to generate the text (see paper below for more details)
6. plausibility_score - the plausibility score determined by crowd annotators
7. plausibility_label - the plausibility label (score > 0.7)
8. stance_conf - the confidence of the majority stance, as determined by crowd annotators
9. stance_label - the majority stance annotation
10. combined_label - the combined plausibility and stance label: 1 if (plausibility_label == 1 and stance_label is either Pro or Con), 0 otherwise

The CSV file generated_texts_factual_opinion.csv contains the following information:

1. model, set, topic, text - see above
2. factual_label - whether the text was determined to be factual or an opinion
3. factual_conf - the confidence of the label

The CSV file generated_texts_covid_19.csv contains the following information:

1. prefix, topic, text - see above
2. combined_label - a label determined by the authors as to whether the text is both plausible and stance-bearing (for 2/5 topics)
