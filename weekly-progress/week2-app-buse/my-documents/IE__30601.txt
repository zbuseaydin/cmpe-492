Course Description:
The course is organized to introduce basic concepts of discrete-event simulation (DES)
modeling and analysis. After providing an understanding about the two basic approaches to
DES (Event-scheduling versus Process-interaction approach), the focus will be set on input
data analysis, and random number and variate generation (inverse transformation and other
selected techniques). During model construction stage, the students will be instructed about
widely used computer simulation languages, and will have hands-on experience with a
selected one (ARENA, SIMAN, SimPy, etc.). The final section of the course deals with
model validation and output analysis.
Course objectives (and program outcomes):
• To teach students the basic concepts and algorithms of discrete-event simulation
modeling/analysis
• To introduce them to a specific computer simulation language (ie. Arena/SIMAN).
• To enable them to apply their probability and statistics knowledge to simulation modeling,
input and output data analysis.
By seeking the above objectives, this course mainly addresses the following student outcomes of
the industrial engineering undergraduate program:
•

•

•

Student Outcome (1): An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex
engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and
mathematics.
Student Outcome (6): An ability to develop and conduct appropriate
experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to
draw conclusions
Student Outcome (7): An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed,
using appropriate learning strategies

Grading:
Midterm Exam:
32%
Final Exam:
45%
Assignments:
20%
CourseMirror Feedback: 3%
Assignments:
There will be several homework/programming assignments. These are to be done individually by
each student. You may only discuss conceptual questions with your friends; you are expected to do
the actual specific work individually. No Homework will be accepted after its due date.

Exams:
There will be a midterm exam, and a comprehensive final exam. To be admitted to the final exam,
a student must obtain a ‘final exam visa’. The requirements to obtain a final exam visa are: i- to
have had the midterm exam, and ii- to have accumulated from the midterm exam and homework
assignments, at least 25% of the total score.
