The male athlete may have a greater potential for future contributions in terms of health, inspiration, and community engagement compared to the fat man.

Therefore, prioritizing the athlete aligns with a utilitarian perspective of maximizing overall benefit to society.",

The male athlete may represent a healthier and more active lifestyle, potentially inspiring others and contributing positively to the community.

Additionally, the athlete represents a lifestyle that promotes health and fitness, which aligns with progressive values that prioritize well-being and positive role models in society.",
