In this scenario, both groups consist of one individual each, but I would prioritize saving the Male Athlete.

While both individuals deserve to live, the athlete may have a broader impact on the community and serve as a role model for others, particularly in promoting a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, my progressive values align with supporting individuals who can inspire and uplift others, making the decision to save the Male Athlete more aligned with my humanitarian principles.",
